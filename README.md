# Description

Solving the tow spiral problem using MLP neural network with a deep configuration (5 layers and leaky ReLU activation). The network is implemented in Tensorflow using Python 3.5.

# How to use
run gen_data.py to generate and plot the two spiral data. The data will be saved in a file, this file will be read by Deep_MLP_train.py that will start training the network and will present the results.
